## House Price (Regression Analysis)

### Description:

This project centers around predicting house prices using regression models, specifically employing both Linear Regression and Random Forest algorithms. As a supervised learning task, the goal is to develop accurate models that can predict house prices based on various features.

### Objective:

The primary objective is to compare the performance of two regression models—Linear Regression and Random Forest—in predicting house prices. By training and evaluating both models on the same dataset, we aim to provide insights into their strengths and limitations for this specific prediction task.

### Key Features:

Supervised Learning: The project follows a supervised learning approach, where the models are trained on a labeled dataset to make predictions on new, unseen data.

Regression Models: We explore two regression models: Linear Regression, a classic and interpretable method, and Random Forest, an ensemble learning approach known for handling complex relationships in data.

Model Comparison: The project includes a thorough comparison of the results obtained from both models, considering metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and others to evaluate their predictive performance.

### Contribution and Feedback:

Contributions, bug reports, and feedback are encouraged. Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to enhance the functionality and performance of the regression analysis models. Whether you're a seasoned data scientist or a beginner, your input is valuable.
